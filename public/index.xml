A lot of research has been done on the topic simulating snow crystal growth with computationally expensive numerical models. For my research, I thought it would be interesting to use machine learning to emulate and accelerate these simulations. No previous research has been done on simulating snow crystal growth with neural networks, and due to the nonlinearity of the system and its probabilistic nature, this is a very challenging problem. Existing methods for neural simulation of dynamical systems fail to address some of the challenges of snow crystal growth, and fall short of producing accurate and diverse simulations.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
