# Hello ðŸ‘‹

**Welcome to my personal website!**

This is a space for me to share my work, host files I want to share, and host my projects.

Most prominently, I host my [thesis](/pdf/thesis_pol_timmer.pdf) on neural emulators for snow crystal growth. Part of this thesis has also been published in D3S3, a NeurIPS 2024 workshop, and is available on [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=ZdaZoiYeG7), and on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16608).

Feel free to look around!
